# Music Folder Structure
This file outlines the best way I found to organise my music files. This works for me and you can change the structure to suit your music folder. I use Musicbee to organise the files and as such, will use the naming template names for the following.

All the templates below assume you are already in the root music folder. Each title will have an example and a naming template for Musicbee.
## Metadata
The metadata embedded into the music file is important. Here is a list of metadata fields I use to organise the files. Most of these fields need no explanation, I have provided explanation for fields you wouldn't normally use.
* Track Title
* Artist
* Album Artist `This has the folder name ie: Eminem`
* Album
* Year
* Track `track number`
* Disc `disc number, if one disc leave empty`
* Genre
* Grouping `This field is used for country of origin`
* Track Rating
* Language
* Keywords `Can be used for naything, I use for auto playlists`
