# Music Folder Structure
This file outlines the best way I found to organise music files. This is not definitive, think of it as a starting pointfor your own structure to suit yourself. I use Musicbee to organise the files and as such, will outline the naming templates below.

All the templates below assume you are already in the root music folder.
## Metadata
The metadata embedded into the music file is important. Here is a list of useful metadata fields. Most of these fields need no explanation but I have provided explanation for where appropriate.
* Track Title
* Artist
* Album Artist `This has the folder name ie: Hilltop Hoods, Soundtracks etc. This is so you can sort by album-artist in your software of choice.`
* Album
* Year
* Track `track number`
* Disc `disc number, if one disc leave empty`
* Genre
* Grouping `This field is used for country of origin`
* Track Rating
* Language
* Keywords `Can be used for anything, for example keywords for auto playlists`
## Images
These are the most useful images and the naming convention for them.
* logo.png
* backdrop.jpg
* backdrop1.jpg
* banner.jpg
* folder.jpg `Artist photo`
* folder.jpg `Album cover`

To give an example:
* `Limp Bizkit\Still Sucks (2021)[flac]\`folder.jpg `Album cover`
* `Limp Bizkit\`backdrop.jpg
* `Limp Bizkit\`backdrop1.jpg
* `Limp Bizkit\`banner.jpg
* `Limp Bizkit\`folder.jpg `Artist photo`
* `Limp Bizkit\`logo.png
## Single CD Album or Singles Template
`Eminem\Curtain Call (2005)[flac]\01 - Intro.flac`
> `<Artist>\<Album> (<Year>)[<.Ext>]\<Track#> - <Title>`
### Multiple CD Albums Template
`Massive Attack\COLLECTED (2006)[flac]\1-01 - SAFE FROM HARM.flac`
> `<Artist>\<Album> (<Year>)[<.Ext>]\<Disc#>-<Track> - <Title>`
## Single CD Compilation Disc Template
The compilation folder is anything you want it to be. For example, have a folder for movie soundtracks and another for mix CD's.

`Soundtracks\Gone in 60 Seconds OST (2000)[flac]\01 - Painted On My Heart.flac`
> `<compilation folder>\<Album> (<Year>)[<.Ext>]\<Track> - <Artist> - <Title>`
### Multiple CD Compilation Disc Template
`Soundtracks\The Best Movie Album In The World Ever (2008)[flac]\1-01 - Goo Goo Dolls - Iris.flac`
> `<compilation folder>\<Album> (<Year>)[<.Ext>]\<Disc#>-<Track> - <Artist> - <Title>`
## Single Tracks Templates
You may have single tracks laying around in your storage. You can choose between two kinds of sorting. `[Mixed]` in this context shows that there are different types of music files; flac, mp3 etc.
### Single Tracks by Decade
`Various Tracks\1980-1989[Mixed]\Aswad - Don't Turn Around.flac`
> `<compilation folder>\<Decade>[Mixed]\<Artist> - <Title>`
### Single Tracks by Alphabet
`Various Tracks\T[Mixed]\Tenacious D - Tribute (2001).flac`
> `<compilation folder>\<Letter>[Mixed]\<Artist> - <Title> (<Year>)`
