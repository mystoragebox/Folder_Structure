# Home Photos and Videos Folder
If you're like me you've no doubt had many phones and cameras over the years. I recently came up with this folder structure I'm happy with for saving images and videos. It lets me search the folders easily and keeps all the raw files organised with a seperate edited folder if you need it. 

## Personal Photos and Videos
Here I will show how I organise my own photos and videos starting with the naming template.

This template assumes you're in the root images folder already.

* `<Year>\<Numbered Month>-<Device>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

Looking at this template I will now show some examples:

* `2019\04-Canon M3\IMG_0875-Japan.cr2`
* `2023\06-Sony A7RIII\DSC06441-Glamping_Da_Lat.arw`
## Family Photos and Videos
If you are the repositry of your whole family you can put their name next to the device like so:
* `<Year>\<Numbered Month>-<Device>-<Person>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`
* `2004\07-Sony P32-Dad\DSC03462-Beach.jpg`
* `2010\10-Sony SR47E-Dad\M2U00095-Birthday.mpg`
## Edited Images Folder
I like to keep the raw and edited images in seperate folders. The edited images folder struture is similar to the raw folders with a slight change and has it's own root directory away from the raw images folder.

* `<Root>\EDITED IMAGES\<Year>\<Device>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

Notice how the device folders don't have the month. Another example is outlined below with the root folders shown.

* `IMAGES\2018\09-Canon M3\IMG_9223-Botanic_Gardens.cr2`
* `IMAGES EDITED\2018\Canon M3\IMG_9223-Botanic_Gardens.jpg`
