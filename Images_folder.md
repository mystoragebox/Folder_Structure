# Home Photos and Videos Folder
If you're like me you've no doubt had many phones and cameras over the years. I recently came up with this folder structure I'm happy with for saving images and videos. I assume that you are already in the root folder for the images eg:

* `C:\IMAGES\.....`

### Folder Names
You start with the main year folder than create sub-folders for the months. You can then type in metadata into the month folder name to describe where the contents came from. Keeping it basic is key, I use a combination of what device it is and if the files belong to another family member. I have a few examples below:

* `2021\12-Motorola Edge20` - My own device
* `2021\12-Sony A7RIII` - My own device
* `2021\12-Sony ZV1-Joel` - A family members device

### Searchable Files
To keep the files searchable I write a few words in the filename. You should use descriptive words for this that clearly convey what the file is for. I edit the filenames with powertoys when copying to my pc. Below are a few examples:

* Joel_Birthday
* Christmas
* Japan_Trip
* Family_Reunion
* Road_Trip

The filename will look like this `IMG_9223-Botanic_Gardens.cr2`

## Personal Photos and Videos
This is the template I use for files that are saved from my own devices. Once you're in the root images folder you can create folder structures like this:

* `<Year>\<Numbered Month>-<Device>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

Looking at this template I will now show some examples:

* `2019\04-Canon M3\IMG_0875-Japan.cr2`
* `2023\06-Sony A7RIII\DSC06441-Glamping_Da_Lat.arw`
## Family Photos and Videos
If you backup files from your family you can put their name next to the device in the folder name like so:

* `<Year>\<Numbered Month>-<Device>-<Person>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

Again looking at this template I will show you some examples:

* `2004\07-Sony P32-Dad\DSC03462-Beach.jpg`
* `2010\10-Sony SR47E-Dad\M2U00095-Birthday.mpg`
## Edited Images Folder
I like to keep the raw and edited images in seperate folders. The edited images folder struture is similar to the raw folders with a slight change and has it's own root directory away from the raw images folder.

* `C:\EDITED IMAGES\<Year>\<Device>-<Person>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

Notice how the device folders don't have the month, instead it has the device and family member if needed. Another example of the raw and edited folder structure is outlined below.

* `C:\IMAGES\2018\09-Canon M3\IMG_9223-Botanic_Gardens.cr2`
* `C:\IMAGES EDITED\2018\Canon M3\IMG_9223-Botanic_Gardens.jpg`

Of course you can keep the same file structure in both the raw and edited folders but in my experience you would have 100's and possibly 1000's more images in the raw folder, the edited folder does not need that level of seperation.
