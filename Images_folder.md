# Home Photos and Videos Folder
If you're like me you have had many phones and cameras over the years. I recently came up with this folder structure I'm happy with. It lets me search the folders easily and keeps all the raw files organised. For edited photos and video I have made another folder outside of this folder, this is explaned on another page. Below I have a naming template and I'll give examples afterwards. This template assumes you're in the root images folder already.

`<Year>\<Numbered Month>-<Device>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

Looking at this template I will now show some examples:

`2019\04-Canon M3\IMG_0875-Japan.cr2`

`2023\06-Sony A7RIII\DSC06441-Glamping_Da_Lat.arw`

If you are the repositry of your whole family you can put their name next to the device like so:

`<Year>\<Numbered Month>-<Device>-<Person>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

`2004\07-Sony P32-Dad\DSC03462-Beach.jpg`

`2010\10-Sony SR47E-Dad\M2U00095-Birthday.mpg`
