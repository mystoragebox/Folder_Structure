# Home Photos and Videos Folder
If you're like me you have had many phones and cameras over the years. I recently came up with this folder structure I'm happy with. It lets me search the folders easily and keeps all the raw files organised. For edited photos and video I have made another folder outside of this folder, this is explaned on another page. Below I have a naming template and I'll give examples afterwards. This template assumes you're in the images folder already.

`<Year>\<Numbered Month>-<Device>\<Filename>-<Description>.<ext>`

Looking at this template I will now show a example:

`2019\04-Canon M3\IMG_0875-Japan.cr2`
