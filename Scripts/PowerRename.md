# PowerRename Hints
Here are some common hints I use to organise my files using powertoys. 

## Replace Everything Between...
This will replace everything between square brackets or anything you change it to. When using this check the **Regular expressions** box.

* `\[(.*?)\]`

## Insert String
This will insert a string while including the orignial filename. When using this check the **Regular expressions** box.

* `(.*)`
* `My Text $1`
