# Scripts and Hints
Here you will find a small collection of useful scripts for converting and some hints for organising files.
## CBR to CBZ
In this folder you will find a Python script to bulk change CBR comic files to CBZ files. You may want to do this if your comic reader doesn't completely support CBR or you want to keep your collection in CBZ.
