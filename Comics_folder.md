# Comic Folder Structure
This is a guide on how to organise comics in a folder structure that is easy to navigate and prioritises using a program to bring the comics together into collections. You can use seperate root folders for comics, manga, manwha etc. but if you have a small collection maybe one root folder is all you need. This guide assumes that the comics are all in one root folder:

`C:\SEQUENTIAL-ART\.....`
## Metadata
There are two methods to have metadata for comics, the first is to have a comicinfo.xml file in the same folder as the comics. The next is to have a comicinfo.xml embedded into the comic file. There are pros and cons to each method but the overview is with a commicinfo.xml in the folder you will be limited to the information for all volumes of that comic of that comic while the embedded file can hold metadata for each volume or chapter of the comic.

There are many ways to make the metadata for the comics but the best way is to find a metadata scraper on github and use that. There is a python script that I have made scraping data using anilist api that is in the scripts folder. See the script for more information.
