# Folder Structure Guidelines
This respositry has guidelines to keep folder structure consistant on a PC or server. Like it states these are guidelines and can be changed to suite yourself. There are already well established guides on music, movies and tv shows, here the basics are outlined for convenience.

Like it says above, these are basic folder structures that have been useful and others may find value to organise their own storage. The biggest benefit for others being folder structures that aren't so well documented like personal images, comics, music videos etc. There has been many hours testing what folder structures work and what metadata to use to keep files organised. It is not set in stone and it may change things from time to time.

There are a few different pieces of software used to organise files and they are:
* `Powertoys` - Great for bulk renaming files
* `Musicbee` - Organise music and music videos
* `Jellyfin` - Share content locally with devices in your home
* `Python programming language` - bulk converting music video file types and more
The first three programs have vibrant communities around them and python is a shortcut for converting files so it's not needed much.
## Comics
Comics have limited guides on the internet for folder stuctures. Some people like to organise by studio or keep collections in the same folder. The way that is outlined in this guide describes another way. This guide has a structure that prioritises using your program of choice to organise the comics into collections using metadata. This way may not be better or worse than other folder structures but it works well for Jellyfin.
## Images
The images folder organises personal photos and videos into year/month categories. Each month has data for the device it was taken with and if the device belongs to someone else. The files have a few words to describe what the file is for. This folder is designed to save your original/raw files. I have outlined a way to save your edited files as well in a seperate root folder.
## Music
This mostly follows the well established guides on saving music to folders. This does not cover audiobooks and music videos are in a seperate guide. This guide mostly outlines metadata fields and useful Musicbee renaming templates.
