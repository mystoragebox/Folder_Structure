# Folder Structure Guidelines
I made this respositry to keep my folder structure consistant. Like it states these are guidelines and can be changed to suite yourself. Some of these folder structures overlap with what is already being shown online or what is required for software like Musicbee or Jellyfin. 

I made this public because somebody out there might find it useful to organise their own storage. I've spent countless hours researching online and trialing folder stuctures for myself to get to this guide. It is not set in stone and I may change things from time to time.
## Music
The music folder is only for audio based music file-types. you shouldn't save music videos, audio books etc. in this folder. Doing it this way helps  software like Musicbee and Jellyfin categorise the content without errors.
## Images
The images folder has both home photos and videos. This folder is for saving the raw files that come from your devices only, this is so you can use software like lightroom to edit the raw files and save them in another location.
