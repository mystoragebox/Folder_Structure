# Folder Structure Guidelines That I Use
I made this respositry to keep my folder structure rules in one place. Its public because somebody might find this information useful!! I have made a page for each category. I will update and add to this moving forward.
## Music
The music folder is only for audio based music file-types. I don't save music videos, audio books etc. in this folder. Doing it this way helps keep the content management software happy, in my case Jellyfin.
## Images
The images folder has both home photos and videos. Photos includes image/video backups from your camera and phone.
