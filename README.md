# Folder Structure Guidelines
This respositry has guidelines to keep folder structure consistant on a PC or server. Like it states these are guidelines and can be changed to suite yourself. There are already well established guides on music, movies and tv shows, I have the basics for these file types outlined in this guide for my own convenience.

Like it says above, these are basic folder structures that I have found useful and up until this guide was made the guidelines were saved in txt files. I thought loading up github with these guides will help me keep organised and may help others to organise their own storage. The biggest benefit for others being folder structures that aren't so well documented like personal images, comics, music videos etc. There has been many hours testing what folder structures work and what metadata to use to keep files organised. It is not set in stone and it may change over time.

## Comics
Comics have limited guides on the internet for folder stuctures. Some people like to organise by studio or keep collections in the same folder. The way that is outlined in this guide describes another way. This guide has a structure that prioritises using your program of choice to organise the comics into collections using metadata. This way may not be better or worse than other folder structures but it works well for me.

## Images
The images folder organises personal photos and videos into year/month categories. Each month has data for the device it was taken with and if the device belongs to someone else. The files have a few words to describe what the file is for. This folder is designed to save your original/raw files. I have also described a way to save your edited files in a seperate root folder.

## Music
This mostly follows the well established guides on saving music to folders. This does not cover audiobooks or music videos. This guide mostly outlines metadata fields and useful Musicbee renaming templates.

## Music Video
The file structure for music videos is very similar to music. The main difference is there is no sub folders for albums. I convert all video files into mp4 so metadata from Musicbee can be used and accessed by Jellyfin.

## Movies and TV Shows
I don't have a guide on these folder structures because they are already very well established. All you need to do is look at the folder recommendations of your preferred software like Jellyfin, Plex etc.
